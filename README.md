# bootstrap-loading-screen

Bootstrap Loading Screen is a loading/splash screen generator that works by using only standard Bootstrap 3.x components.

Using the online generator, the size and the appearance of the screen's elements can be tweaked, especially making use of
[Bootstrap CDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) themes. A 'mix' button is available to randomly generate a new configuration.
An HTML snippet for the configured screen can be viewed and downloaded.
